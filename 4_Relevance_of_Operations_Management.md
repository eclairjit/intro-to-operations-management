# Relevance of Operations Management - Detailed Notes

## 1. Introduction to Operations Management (OM)

- **Definition**: OM is the management of the transformation process that converts inputs (labor, raw materials) into outputs (goods, services).
- **Objectives**:
  - Improve productivity and efficiency.
  - Enhance quality of goods and services.
  - Contribute to economic growth and job creation.
  - Integrate with other business functions (marketing, finance, HR).
- **Key Trends**:
  - Globalization and increased competition.
  - E-commerce and digital transformation.
  - Higher customer expectations.
  - Cost reduction through lean operations.

## 2. Managerial Issues in OM

- **Shift in power to consumers**:
  - Customers demand better quality and faster delivery.
  - Digital platforms give consumers more choices.
- **Productivity challenges**:
  - Balancing cost, quality, and speed.
  - Reducing labor and material costs without sacrificing efficiency.
  - Implementing advanced technologies like automation.

## 3. OM Strategy: A Top-Down Approach

- **Strategic (Long-Range)**:
  - Capacity planning.
  - Aligning operations with business goals.
- **Tactical (Medium-Range)**:
  - Scheduling and resource management.
- **Operational (Short-Range)**:

  - Execution of tasks and activities.
  - Managing daily operations.

  - **Scientific Management (Frederick Taylor)**: Standardization and efficiency.
  - **Operations Research (WWII Era)**: Logistics and quantitative decision-making.
  - **Modern OM**: Integration with IT, lean management, and automation.
- **OM in Services**:
  - Batch cooking (e.g., McDonald’s).
  - Just-in-Time (JIT) inventory management.
  - Automated restocking (e.g., Walmart).

## 7. Differences Between Goods and Services

| Feature              | Goods         | Services              |
| -------------------- | ------------- | --------------------- |
| Tangibility          | Tangible      | Intangible            |
| Inventory            | Can be stored | Cannot be stored      |
| Customer Interaction | Not required  | Required for delivery |
